# Electrified Dirt

Electrified dirt is a block found under a layer of electrified grass in the electric biome.

## Natural Generation

Electrified dirt is found at any altitude, and comprises the majority of the upper terrain layers in the electric biome, bridging the gap between stone and electric grass blocks in various thicknesses.

## Usage

### Electrified grass spreading

When an electrified dirt block is adjacent to an electrified grass block, it is eventually converted into an electrified grass block at random intervals.
